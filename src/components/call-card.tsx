            Hi Everyone!
            <br />So I always get asked: how did you get into this business? And
            the answer is a few years ago when I was doing corporate events a
            client had asked for feather centerpieces. I had looked near and far
            and found that they were SUPER expensive to even rent! I wanted them
            to be a bit more affordable for different budgets! So here I am four
            years later making it my mission to provide quality & budget
            friendly feathers and centerpieces. You can buy them for the same
            amount you would rent them from most places, so I think i've
            succeeded! I hope you find what you are looking for in my shop, and
            if you don't please let me know I am happy to put together something
            custom for you! I absolutely love what I do. There is something
            magical about feathers as no two are really ever the same. ðŸ’–
            <br /> <br /> Warmly, Sonia
